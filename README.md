# Wireless Data Transmission Simulation
This project demonstrates how to simulate a system using a MicroPython-compatible microcontroller to wirelessly transmit real-time pipeline data to a remote dashboard. The system uses MQTT for low-latency communication.
## Approach


## Features
- Collects real-time pipeline data such as pressure and temperature.
- Transmits data wirelessly using an MQTT protocol.
- Displays real-time data on a remote dashboard.
- Ensures efficient data transmission with low latency.
